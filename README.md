As a part of my Business Analyst training at ExcelR institute. I had an opportunity to work on a Bank Analytics project that helped me in understanding of business intelligence and data-driven decision-making in the financial services domain. The project is based on understanding the banking metrics like Loan disbursement trends, default rates and state wise branch performance using real life inspired data.

Overview:
At first, I analysed the bank data using Excel, this process includes data cleaning which helps in creating a reliable dashboard featuring 6 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Secondly, I used SQL to extract and uncover deeper insights. I also utilized powerful visualization tools like Power Bi and tableau to build interactive dynamic dashboards that made key insights easier to understand.

KPIs:

•	Very Low Default Rate Shows Strong Loan Management

•	Most of the bank’s money is given out as home loans, making it the main type of loan they offer.

•	Most loans are taken by people who either have a mortgage or are living on rent.

•	The bank gave out the most loans and acquired new clients in 2018 and 2019.

•	Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana Are Key Markets.

•	People aged 26 to 35 have borrowed the most money.

•	The biggest reason people take loans is to buy a home, which makes up $165 million.

•	45% of all loan money was given to people whose details were fully verified.

•	Loan Collections Were Highest in 2017 and have gone down since then.

•	People with credit grades in the B and C range are borrowing the most.

•	Almost 83% of all loans are being repaid and are considered as “Good Loans”.

•	Only about 17% of loans went bad, but the bank still recovered more money than it gave out in those cases.

•	Fully paid loans are the main source of the bank’s collections.
